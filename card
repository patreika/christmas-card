      Hi my mus mus,
      <br><br>
      I just wanted to say thank you for being apart of my life. I'm so happy and grateful that Jesus put you in my life. I love being able to spend my days with you whenever I get the chance, and that you're truly an amazing man!
      <br><br>
      I know that I've never really went into specifics as to why I think that, so here it is:
      <br><br>
      I like the way you get so focused whenever you're talking about a topic (that you know quite a lot about which is most things) or whenever you're trying to remember something. I love how family-oriented you are (I tell you that quite a lot lol). I love how intellectually mature you are (you truly know how to communicate), in addition to being analytical, insightful, and literally everything that encapsulates being intellectual (love how your mind works). I love that you are a leader; just knowing that I could depend on you is a comforting feeling. I love your smile because when you do, so do your eyes, and it's the cutest thing ever!
      <br><br>
      You're such a sweet, kind, and considerate person. I like that you're always trying to fix your time management‚Äîshows that you are self-aware and you're willing to change. I love how you're always striving to do something for your betterment (i.e. school work, personal growth). I love how intentional you are. I love how endearingly talkative you are, always keeping the convo interesting and lively. I absolutely love your fashion sense! I love that you're hardworking, always striving to get the outcome that you want. And I guesssss I think you're one of the funniest people ever.
      <br><br>
      I love being able to spend time with you whether it's chilling at school, calling on the phone, or going on dates. I haven't felt these strong feelings for someone in a long time, and I'm glad that it's you!! I could definitely get into a lot more, but I do want it to be short and sweet :)
      <br><br>
      I feel like this would've been sweeter in person, but this is just as good since you'll always be able to look at it again. I just wanted to say that I really like you, bubba‚Äîlike really, really‚Äîand I can't wait to see our future together. Mwahhh!
      <br><br>
      Yours, truly
      <br><br>
      Your, P <3
    </p>
